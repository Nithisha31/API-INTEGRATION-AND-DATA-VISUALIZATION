# API-INTEGRATION-AND-DATA-VISUALIZATION

COMPANY: CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS

NAME: RASAKATLA NITHISHA

INTERN ID: CT04DM855

DOMAIN: PYTHON PROGRAMMING 

DURATION: 4 WEEKS

MENTOR: NEELA SANTOSH

PLATFORM USED: VS CODE

INTRODUCTION

Description:
The core objective of my internship was to build a web-based dashboard that collects data from external APIs and visualizes it in a user-friendly and meaningful way. I began by identifying suitable public APIs and understanding their documentation, endpoints, and authentication requirements.

Fetching data from RESTful APIs (e.g., weather, financial, and health statistics)
Designing interactive charts, graphs, and dashboards to display insights clearly

Tools and Technologies Used:
Fetch API & Axios – For making HTTP requests to third-party APIs

Chart.js & Google Charts – JavaScript libraries for building responsive and interactive charts

JSON – Data format for API responses

Git & GitHub – For version control, collaboration, and documentation

Editor Platform Used:

All development work was done using Visual Studio Code (VS Code). It provided an efficient coding environment with features such as syntax highlighting, IntelliSense, live server previews, and Git integration. This helped streamline my workflow and made debugging and testing more efficient. I also used Postman to test and validate API responses before integrating them into my application.

Applicability of This Project:

The skills and tools applied in this project are highly relevant across multiple domains. The concepts of API integration and data visualization can be applied in areas such as:

Business Intelligence Dashboards – Real-time sales, finance, or inventory tracking

Weather Monitoring Systems – Displaying current conditions and forecasts from weather APIs

Social Media Analytics – Fetching and analyzing engagement metrics from social APIs
